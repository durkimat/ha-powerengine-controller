# Changelog

Every release lists **Behaviour changes** (anything that changes what PowerEngine does to your system) first.

## 0.0.2 (beta)

### Behaviour changes
- None. Still a scaffold that never controls anything.

### Fixed
- 0.0.1 read its own AppDaemon definition file as the settings file (AppDaemon passes every app a `config_path` argument). The optional override is now called `settings_file`, and unknown top-level keys in `config.yaml` are rejected.

### Docs
- README: AppDaemon add-on setup (`app_dir`) so it loads apps installed by HACS.

## 0.0.1 (beta)

### Behaviour changes
- None. Scaffold only: loads and validates `config.yaml` and logs the result. Never controls anything.

### Added
- Repository structure, HACS metadata, CI (lint, tests, HACS validation).
