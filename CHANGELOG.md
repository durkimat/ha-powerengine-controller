# Changelog

Every release lists **Behaviour changes** (anything that changes what PowerEngine does to your system) first.

## Unreleased

### Docs
- Full installation guide (`docs/INSTALL.md`), linked from the README.

## 0.0.3 (beta)

### Behaviour changes
- None to your devices: this build is Passive-only and never controls anything.
- New: PowerEngine now creates a **PowerEngine** device in HA (via MQTT) with five entities:
  `sensor.pe_diag_version`, `sensor.pe_diag_heartbeat`, `binary_sensor.pe_diag_config_ok`,
  `sensor.pe_cfg_operation_mode` and `sensor.pe_state_operation_mode`.

### Added
- Operation mode (`operation.mode: passive | active`, default passive). Active is refused by this build.
- Optional additional solar plants (`solar_plants:` list) in `config.yaml`.
- `remove_entities: true` removes every PowerEngine entity.

### Changed
- `operation.dry_run` replaced by `operation.mode`.

### Setup
- Requires AppDaemon's MQTT plugin (see README, "MQTT (one-off)").

## 0.0.2 (beta)

### Behaviour changes
- None. Still a scaffold that never controls anything.

### Fixed
- 0.0.1 read its own AppDaemon definition file as the settings file (AppDaemon passes every app a `config_path` argument). The optional override is now called `settings_file`, and unknown top-level keys in `config.yaml` are rejected.

### Docs
- README: AppDaemon add-on setup (`app_dir`) so it loads apps installed by HACS.

## 0.0.1 (beta)

### Behaviour changes
- None. Scaffold only: loads and validates `config.yaml` and logs the result. Never controls anything.

### Added
- Repository structure, HACS metadata, CI (lint, tests, HACS validation).
